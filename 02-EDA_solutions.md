# Data Visualisation
## Exercises

Let's take the analysis a step further by working with more complex datasets. The goal will be to understand and draw insights from a dataset describing a phenomenon. To do this, you will have the choice of working with a database of 10 datasets.


## Description of the challenge

For this challenge, we will perform what is called _Exploratory Data Analysis_ or _EDA_. The principle is to explore a dataset via graphs and statistical analysis in order to better understand it and to draw interesting information about it. This also happens upstream of a Machine Learning process. In this exercise you will therefore have to:

*   Choose a dataset from the dataset in the _src_ folder
*   Put you in pairs to perform your analyses
*   With Tableau, create your BE
*   Present your analysis results in the form of a Storyboard or PowerPoint presentation.


## An example of a challenge

If you wish to have a vision of what is an exploratory data visualization, you can rely on Frédéric Lopes' presentation which presents data he has taken from Airbnb France :

**NB:** Naturally, concentrate only on the visualisation part and not on the Machine Learning part.


## Tips for this challenge

* Make sense of your graphics
* Have a frame on what you want to present
* Finish with recommendations
* Datasets can be big, don't hesitate to reduce them a little on Excel before installing them on Tableau. This will save you from having a slow machine.
